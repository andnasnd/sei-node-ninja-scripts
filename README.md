## About
This repository contains a collection of `bash` scripts designed for Sei Node Operators

These scripts are designed to simplify common tasks, automate processes, and enhance the operation of Sei nodes

I wrote these to help with monitoring my own node performance, managing logs, and edit configs

Hope they're useful! I chain them together per use-case

Didn't include a guide on how I optimize Sei nodes, will try to get around to it at some point

## Features
- Plug-n-play: These scripts are ready to use with minimal setup
- Automation: Simplify repetitive tasks and streamline node management
- Enhance Node Performance: Implement optimizations and best practices
- Monitoring: Keep an eye on your node's health and performance

**Note:** Please review each script and use them responsibly

**Note:** If you're having trouble running these scripts, it's a good idea to `man bash`

**Feel free to improve, contribute, and modify these scripts to benefit the Sei community.**

Cheers
